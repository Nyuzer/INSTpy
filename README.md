### Automated subscription to users in instagram by txt file 🐍
The program is written entirely in Python using the Selenium framework. 

---
### Installation

First you must clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Nyuzer/INSTpy.git
```
Next, all the necessary requirements must be installed:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After everything is installed, you just need to run the program:
```
python main.py
```
> For convenience, a file 'file_nik.txt' was created in the 'base' directory, you have to fill this file with the nicknames of the people you want to subscribe to. Services for generating such txt files can help you with this.

>> P.S. Soon I'll write a program to generate txt files with nicknames:)# INSTpy
